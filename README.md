# Soil Management System

A database management project developed using MySQL to store, manage, and maintain soil sample information, including farmer details, soil types, pH values, nutrient levels, moisture, and recommended crops.

## 📌 About the Project

The Soil Management System is designed to make soil record management easier and more organised. It stores important information about soil samples, such as farmer name, location, soil type, pH value, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, moisture percentage, and recommended crops.

The project allows users to add, view, update, delete, and search soil records. It helps maintain soil information in a single database and makes it easier to manage and retrieve records whenever required.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts using MySQL, SQL, and PHP.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Store and manage soil sample records.
- Maintain farmer and location information.
- Record different types of soil.
- Store soil pH values and nutrient levels.
- Maintain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium details.
- Store soil moisture information.
- Add, update, view, and delete soil records.
- Search soil records easily.
- Practise relational database design and SQL queries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- MySQL
- SQL
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- XAMPP
- MySQL Workbench
- Git and GitHub
